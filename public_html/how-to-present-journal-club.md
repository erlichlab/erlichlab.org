## Why do we have journal club

Some reasons for of a journal club (not in order of importance):

1. Keep up with the literature
2. Get exposed to classic papers
3. Learning new methods (experimental, analysis, visualization of data)
4. Learn to critically read scientific papers.
5. Learn to effectively give presentations.

## Choosing a paper

The ideal paper for a journal club is one that is interesting to the presenter **and** the audience. This is not always possible. However, before committing to a certain paper, the presenter should skim it to decide whether it is worthy of further investigation. We all value our time, and it is frustrating when a paper is really uninteresting. The process of choosing a paper should be done well before the presentation.

## Reading the paper

Give yourself time to read and deeply understand the paper. This deep understanding usually comes from reading additional background papers, writing the authors to ask clarifying questions, talking to others in the lab or department (or the larger neuroscience community) in order to really understand the paper, so that when you present you can teach your audience what you have learned.

This process is time consuming, which is why it is best to present work that is relevant to your own interests/research, so that understanding the paper is not a waste of time, but a necessary part of your own development.

My approach, when reading for a journal club, is to first read the abstract and extract the main claims of the paper. Then I read the introduction to get the background. If I am unfamiliar with the topic, I will read a few keys papers mentioned in the introduction, find a recent review, and especially look for citations that might hint that there are other labs that disagree with the view of the authors. Then I read the methods to really understand **what they did**. Sometimes, it is hard to understand the methods on their own, and I will go back and forth between results and methods. Then read the results. Although it is common to focus on the figures when presenting, this can be a mistake, because there can be many important results stated in the text that are missing from the figures. Finally, I will read the conclusions.

While reading, I mark in the margins where all the figure citations (eg. F1, F2e, SF2) are so that I can easily find the text related to a figure. I mark places in the text that I don't understand with an underline and a **?** in the margins. I mark text that I think is wrong (logically flawed or not backed up by the data) with an underline and an **X** in the margins. I **always** read the supplement for a journal club. These days the supplement is required to understand what the authors did.

Having read the paper once, I go back and see if any of my `?` or `X` in the margins have been resolved. If I still have unanswered questions, I need to resolve them. Sometimes the fastest way to resolve the question is to simply write the authors. Do not be shy about writing authors of papers. This is why there is a "corresponding author". If you are nervous about whether your question is good ask around the lab or the department first. This is also a good opportunity to engage with professors in the department that are outside the lab. Maybe the authors of the paper cite the work of someone you know. Ask them if they have read the paper, what did they think, can they help you understand something?

## Preparing the presentation

**WIP**

1. Start with "Why did I choose this paper"
2. What is the scientific question that the authors are trying to ask? What do we already know about that question? What are the key results from the literature? Give background!! (At least 5 minutes, with figures from other papers/reviews/textbooks). 
3. Annotate figures. In most cases, the figures can be improved with extra annotation. Help out the audience and add extra information to the figures. Add animations, to point on key features. 
4. Make sure to include supplemental figures that are important for understanding the method.


## Following up with the authors

During the presentation, collect all the good questions that the group has and contact the authors afterwards to ask them. Networking is a huge part of science!! Authors generally appreciate thoughtful questions and people interested in their work. Next time you see one of the authors at a conference, you can say "Hi, I'm Jeff, we corresponded about your paper. I just wanted to say hi and thanks for your help in answering my quesions!". (But if your name isn't Jeff, use your own name.)
