### About The Lab

The Erlich Lab is generally interested in neural mechanisms underlying cognition. We currently have ongoing projects related to economic decision-making, integrating of value and perceptional information, spatial cognition and motor planning. We are located in Shanghai, China. Our animal facilities are hosted at the [East China Normal University campus near Zhongshan Park](http://english.ecnu.edu.cn/1810/list.htm), where we also run human neuroimaging studies using their fMRI facilities. There is a human behavioral research lab hosted at the [NYU Shanghai campus in Pudong](https://wp.nyu.edu/shbeel/).

The lab will be moving to the [Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour](https://www.sainsburywellcome.org/web/) in London, UK at the end of 2021. 

### Hiring

The lab at NYU Shanghai is ramping down, but the lab in London is ramping up. If you are interested in a post-doc, PhD, staff or internship please write to apply@erlichlab.org, including your CV and a cover letter explaining your interest.
