### About The Lab

The Erlich Lab is generally interested in neural mechanisms underlying cognition. We currently have ongoing projects related to economic decision-making, integrating of value and perceptional information, and motor planning. We are located in Shanghai, China. Our animal facilities are hosted at the [East China Normal University campus near Zhongshan Park](http://english.ecnu.edu.cn/1810/list.htm), where we also run human neuroimaging studies using their fMRI facilities. There is a human behavioral research lab hosted at the [NYU Shanghai campus in Pudong](https://wp.nyu.edu/shbeel/).

### Hiring

We are seeking a postdoctoral fellow or senior research staff with experience in rodent behavior,
electrophysiology and optogenetics to work on a set of
recently developed visuomotor tasks which involve complex visual
perception, spatial cognition, learning, movement planning, updating and
execution. Send a cover letter and CV to apply@erlichlab.org
